//transformers will be used to identify/recognize objects in images
//CNN and transformer can be paired to take feature maps of CNN

//Patches obtained from feature maps can have spatial size 1x1
//which means that the input sequence is obtained by simply 
//flattening the spacial dimensions of the feature map and
//projecting to the Transformer dimension
