# Summary
 - Reinforcement learning is a section of machine learning that designs an algorithm to learn how to achieve tasks from positive and negative rewards. When implemented with deep neural networks, it has been cutting edge in the world of AI. 
 - This project was designed to show the potential of the learning algorithm within a discrete space.

# Environment
- The agent is operating within an environment that is discrete; meaning it has a finite set of state spaces (37) that it can travel to. 
- The environment also has bananas scattered around it, blue and yellow.
- It's built using Unity and Gym.

# Dependencies/Installations
To work with the environment you must install gym, you can do so by using following [this repository](https://github.com/openai/gym).
These repositories can also be used for the following dependencies:
